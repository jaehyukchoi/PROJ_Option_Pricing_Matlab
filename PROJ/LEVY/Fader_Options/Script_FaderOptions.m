%%% FADER OPTION PRICER
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Descritpion: Script to Price Fader (Soft) Barrier options in Levy Models
%              using the PROJ method. 
% Fade-In Payoff is (1 - R)*(S_T - W)^+ for a call, where R is the proportion of time spent in knock-out region
%   (Note: Fade out can be priced by parity, (Fade-in + Fade-out = Vanilla), so Price(Fade-out) = Price(Vanilla) - Price(Fade-in)
